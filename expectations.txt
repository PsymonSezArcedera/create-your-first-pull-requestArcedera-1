My expectations this semester in CMSC 100 is that I will be able to have a deepers understanding about web programming while also collaborating with other people. I also expect a fun and meaningful journey in this course.

I also hope to further enhance my knowledge regarding web programming. I think I still have many things to learn especially in the backend.
